* **1920s–30s:** Mechanical and then electronic television systems emerge.
* **1950s:** Widespread broadcast TV; analog signals dominate.
* **1970s–80s:** VHS and Betacam introduce portable recording; digital experimentation begins.
* **1990s:** Digital video (DV) and MPEG compression make video storage and transmission viable.
* **2000s:** Broadband + codecs like H.264 transform online streaming; YouTube launches (2005).
* **2010s:** Adaptive bitrate streaming (HLS/DASH) becomes standard; GPUs accelerate encoding.
* **Late 2010s:** Live streaming explodes (Twitch, Instagram Live); mobile video becomes the majority of internet traffic.
* **2020s:** AI enters the pipeline — upscaling, captioning, generative video, real-time inference; decentralised GPU networks like Livepeer make video compute cheaper and globally accessible.
