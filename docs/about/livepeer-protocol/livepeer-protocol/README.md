# Livepeer Protocol

Livepeer is a full-stack platform for video streaming & AI. The video streaming software is underpinned by a network of actors that perform the work needed to compute, transcode & orchestrate video & AI jobs in the Livepeer network.\
\
The Livepeer Protocol is the underlying code that enforces the mechanisms and rules to ensure the reliability, cooperation and coordination of these decentralised actors.
