# Gateways 101

Gateways aggregate customer requests for video transcoding and, more recently, AI workloads, and distribute the jobs to Livepeer's network of Orchestrators (GPU nodes).&#x20;

[Some earlier sources](https://livepeer-ac43ab.webflow.io/primer) refer to this role as **broadcaster**.&#x20;

An essential part of the Livepeer Protocol, Gateways earn revenue by&#x20;



A list of Gateways running on Livepeer, and their performance can be found at the [Livepeer Tools](https://www.livepeer.tools/) site under [Gateway directory](https://www.livepeer.tools/gateways).





> From [gaps report](https://github.com/shtukaresearch/livepeer-data-geography/blob/main/roles/gateway.md): identified gaps
>
> * **Clear explanation of the Gateway role within Livepeer.**
> * Clear, discoverable explanation of current status quo on Protocol-level measures to mitigate fault risks, particularly safety faults.
> * Production-grade, transparent Orchestrator directory with performance and reliability data and extended capability reporting.
>   * Livepeer Tools Orchestrator page is a good start, but seems to be down often, "latency score" is unclear, data source is unclear, and is not discoverable through the explorer.
> * Targeted grant or subsidy programme for new Gateways in focus areas.
