# Livepeer Token Economics

{% hint style="info" %}
See more on the LPT Token here [https://www.livepeer.org/lpt](https://www.livepeer.org/lpt)
{% endhint %}



Livepeer is a utility token used to power & secure the decentralised Livepeer Network, enabling reliable, cost-efficient, powerful AI and video streaming functions.

One of the biggest competitive advantages of Livepeer is its decentralisation - creating free markets and competitive pricing. This network of decentralised nodes, orchestrators, gateways and broadcasters, and the flow of payments in the network for doing useful work, is underpinned by the Livepeer Token (LPT)

#### Actors

* **Broadcaster (payer)** → submits jobs (video/AI) and funds them using **Probabilistic Micropayments (PM) tickets**.
* **Orchestrator (validator/worker coordinator)** → stakes LPT (self-stake + delegated), wins work, forwards segments to…
* **Transcoder (work executor)** → performs compute (encode/transcode/inference) for the orchestrator.
* **Delegator (capital provider)** → bonds LPT to an orchestrator, shares its rewards & fees.
* GPU Providers are paid for running AI Jobs

**Flow:**&#x20;

Broadcaster → (PM tickets/segments) → Orchestrator → (tasks) → Transcoder → (results) → Broadcaster.

\
**Economic weight flows:**&#x20;

Delegators → (bonded LPT) → Orchestrator → (rewards/fees split back) → Delegators.
