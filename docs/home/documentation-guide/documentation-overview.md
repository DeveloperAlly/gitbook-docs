# Documentation Overview

### Doc's Outline

Livepeer is a vibrant and broad ecosystem, and the community is equally diverse, ranging from creators, developers, founders, hardware operators, AI scientists, web3 participants, end-users and many, many more.

Learning is also different for everyone, with user preferences as unique as the community across the following:

* Format (like text, engineering references or video),&#x20;
* Style of learning (hands-on, reading, visual)
* Content (ELI5)
* AI helpers&#x20;

These docs aim to cater, as much as possible, to all segments of the vibrant Livepeer Community.
